# sql-final-project
The goal of this project is to use SQL to explore and extract insights from data in a database. Made for a final project.

## About the Data
The datasets I used in my database came from Kaggle user [siddharth0935](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharth0935/toy-store-e-commerce-database) and contains data about the sales of a fictional toy e-commerce store.

There are 4 tables in the database:
orders
order_items
order_item_refunds
products
